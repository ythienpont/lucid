# Explanation

## Topology Definition:
The topology defines a network of five switches with their connections. Each switch has a list of neighbors, where each entry contains a port and a validity flag (indicating whether the port is connected).

## Helper Function (`get_connected_port`):
This function determines which switch is connected via a given output port. It returns the ID of the destination switch or `99` if no valid connection exists.

## Broadcast Group:
The broadcast group contains all five switches. These switches will be involved in the broadcast process.

## Event Definition:
The event `broadcast_event` is a simple placeholder for broadcasting. You can add additional arguments as needed.

## Broadcast Example:
The event is broadcasted to all switches in the network, delayed by 100ns using `Event.delay`. The `generate_ports` function sends the event to all switches in the `broadcast_group`.

# Example Input:
This input defines the number of switches, maximum time, and the event to be broadcasted:

```json
{
  "switches": 5,
  "max time": 9999999,
  "events": [
    {
      "name": "broadcast_event",
      "args": []
    }
  ]
}
